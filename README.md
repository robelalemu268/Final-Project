# Final Assignment
Site Title: Be A Fuji Pro!
I love shooting photos. For 20+ years, I have used different Nikon Cameras. Recently I made the change to a Fujifilm Camera. I did not realize or anticipate how steep the learning curve would be... and yes, I am still climbing. 
My purpose for this site is to provide information on Fuji Cameras (things you should know before and after you buy.
My site would be for 
1- Those that are thinking of Buying a Fuji Camera and What they should know before buying one
2- For those that bought Fuji film cameras like me. It should include information / lesson on how one should go about it... If time allows, I can put a lesson plan “Knowing you Fuji” 
3- Photographers that want to see Fuji Camera photos. It will have links to cool Fuji Photos, accessories and lenses.
